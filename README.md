Hello! I'm a beginner programmer who wants to learn C/C++, Python, and Rust. Most of my experiance is in Python at the moment.
I plan on putting project code here so that I don't lose it due to faulty hard drives, etc.
All of the code posted here is free to use, unless otherwise specified within the repo.

Thanks and have a good day!
